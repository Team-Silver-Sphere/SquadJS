## **About**
The SquadJS API Plugin sends analytics data to the [SquadJS API](https://github.com/Thomas-Smyth/thomas-smyth.uk/tree/master/src/subdomains/squadjs) at regularly intervals. The SquadJS development team use this data to understand the needs of SquadJS users and prioritise areas of development. 

The data includes the following information about your Squad server and SquadJS instance:
 * Host
 * Query Port
 * Name
 * Player Count
 * SquadJS Version
 * Log Reader Mode

The SquadJS API Plugin is enabled by default.
